Here are my personal configuration files for the shell
and a couple other tools I use on a daily basis.

I don't set up a new machine every day, so there is
no automated way to symlink all the needed files out
of this folder.

Here are the suggested links:

~/dotfiles              -> dotfiles
~/.bashrc               -> dotfiles/shellfiles/sample-shellrc
~/.zshrc                -> dotfiles/shellfiles/sample-shellrc
~/.vimrc                -> vimrc
~/.ssh/config           -> ssh-config
~/.gitconfig            -> gitconfig
~/.subversion/config    -> gitconfig
~/.mess                 -> mess
