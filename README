Here are my personal configuration files for the shell
and a couple other tools I use on a daily basis.

I don't set up a new machine every day, so there is
no automated way to symlink all the needed files out
of this folder.

Here are the suggested links:

~/dotfiles     -> dotfiles
~/.bashrc/     -> dotfiles/shellfiles/sample-shellrc
~/.zshrc       -> dotfiles/shellfiles/sample-shellrc
~/.vimrc       -> vimrc
~/.ssh/config  -> ssh-config
~/.mess        -> mess
